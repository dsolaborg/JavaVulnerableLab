[+] [1] Common directory (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     101291190
[~] Severity:   Medium
[~] Description:
[~]
Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some directories may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
directories that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced directories in the hope that the directory will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common names.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the directory exists.

Arachni also contains a list of common directory names which it will attempt to access.

[+] [2] Common directory (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     1471570517
[~] Severity:   Medium
[~] Description:
[~]
Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some directories may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
directories that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced directories in the hope that the directory will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common names.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the directory exists.

Arachni also contains a list of common directory names which it will attempt to access.

[+] [6] Backup file (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     2880035912
[~] Severity:   Medium
[~] Description:
[~]
A common practice when administering web applications is to create a copy/backup
of a particular file or directory prior to making any modification to the file.
Another common practice is to add an extension or change the name of the original
file to signify that it is a backup (examples include `.bak`, `.orig`, `.backup`,
etc.).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate backup files by adding common extensions onto files already discovered on
the webserver. By analysing the response headers from the server they are able to
determine if the backup file exists.
These backup files can then assist in the compromise of the web application.

By utilising the same method, Arachni was able to discover a possible backup file.

Private, or non-routable, IP addresses are generally used within a home or
company network and are typically unknown to anyone outside of that network.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to identify the private IP address range being used
by their victim, to aid in collecting further information that could then lead
to a possible compromise.

Arachni discovered that the affected page returned a RFC 1918 compliant private
IP address and therefore could be revealing sensitive information.

_This finding typically requires manual verification to ensure the context is

[~] Digest:     3796773149

[~] Description:
[~]
Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing)
is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different
from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing
confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on
seemingly innocuous web pages.

The server didn't return an `X-Frame-Options` header which means that this website
could be at risk of a clickjacking attack.

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not
a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can
use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not
embedded into other sites.

[+] [28] Form-based File Upload (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     196651344
[~] Severity:   Informational
[~] Description:
[~]
The design of many web applications require that users be able to upload files
that will either be stored or processed by the receiving web server.

Arachni has flagged this not as a vulnerability, but as a prompt for the
penetration tester to conduct further manual testing on the file upload function.

An insecure form-based file upload could allow a cyber-criminal a means to abuse
and successfully exploit the server directly, and/or any third party that may
later access the file. This can occur through uploading a file containing server
side-code (such as PHP) that is then executed when requested by the client.

[+] [31] HttpOnly cookie (Trusted)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     693978604
[~] Severity:   Informational
[~] Description:
[~]
HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).
